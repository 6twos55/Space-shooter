# Space Shooter

Shoot falling rocks before they evade you!

## How to Play

- Move your ship left and right with the arrow keys or `A`/`D`.
- Shoot rocks by pressing `ArrowUp`, `W`, `Enter`, or by clicking anywhere in the space area. 
- Destroy as many rocks as you can before one reaches the bottom!

- (It is the normal behavior for cursor to disappear when it enters the space area)

## Features

- **Increasing Difficulty:**
  - After 20 seconds: Rocks fall faster, spawn more often, and you can shoot moderately.
  - After 40 seconds: Rocks fall even faster, spawn even more often, and shooting cooldown decreases (meaning you can shoot faster).
  - After 90 seconds: Rocks fall much faster, spawn rate increases, and shooting cooldown is reduced again.
  - After 2 minutes: Rocks fall extremely fast, spawn rate is very high, and shooting cooldown is shortest.
  - After 3.5 minutes: Rocks fall slightly faster, and spawn at their fastest.
- **Game Over:**
  - The game ends if a rock reaches the bottom. Click "PLAY AGAIN" to restart.
